## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: (Coming soon)
- [Live Site](https://frankhukka.github.io/profilink/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge I wanted to try various CSS properties and functions I have recently learned about. Padding scales dynamically with the `clamp()` function. I used the `transition` property to smoothly transition the button colors to the active states. The button section is done with CSS Grid.

I also tried using the `min()` and `max()` functions to scale the profile card section, but that didn't work so well on mobile. Oh well.

### Continued development

In future projects I will try various functions to achieve desired results. I also want to hone my skills with the grid display.

Another new thing I recently learned about is the variable. In this project I didn't see them necessary, but in some future projects I want to try using them.

### Useful resources

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Very useful courses on HTML and CSS. The lessons have helped me greatly in understanding web-designing.
- [MDN References](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - All the necessary info about HTML elements, CSS properties, and more.
